      "abstractNote": "Abnormal sleep is frequent in psychosis; however, sleep abnormalities in different stages (ie, clinical high risk for psychosis [CHR-P], early psychosis [EP], and chronic psychosis [CP]) have not been characterized.To identify sleep abnormalities across psychosis stages.Web of Science and PubMed were searched between inception and June 15, 2022. Studies written in English were included.Sleep disturbance prevalence studies and case-control studies reporting sleep quality, sleep architecture, or sleep electroencephalography oscillations in CHR-P, EP, or CP.This systematic review and meta-analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Stage-specific and pooled random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, along with the assessment of heterogeneity, study quality, and meta-regressions (clinical stage, sex, age, medication status, and psychotic symptoms).Sleep disturbance prevalence, self-reported sleep quality, sleep architecture (total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, nonrapid eye movement, rapid eye movement stages, and number of arousals), and sleep electroencephalography oscillations (spindle density, amplitude, and duration, and slow wave density).Fifty-nine studies with up to 6710 patients (n = 5135 for prevalence) and 977 controls were included. Sleep disturbance prevalence in pooled cases was 50% (95% CI, 40%-61%) and it was similar in each psychosis stage. Sleep quality was worse in pooled cases vs controls (standardized mean difference [SMD], 1.00 [95% CI, 0.70-1.30]). Sleep architecture alterations included higher sleep onset latency (SMD [95% CI]: pooled cases, 0.96 [0.62-1.30]; EP, 0.72 [0.52-0.92]; CP, 1.36 [0.66-2.05]), higher wake after sleep onset (SMD [95% CI]: pooled cases, 0.5 [0.29-0.71]; EP, 0.62 [0.34-0.89]; CP, 0.51 [0.09-0.93]), higher number of arousals (SMD [95% CI]: pooled cases, 0.45 [0.07-0.83]; CP, 0.81 [0.30-1.32]), higher stage 1 sleep (SMD [95% CI]: pooled cases, 0.23 [0.06-0.40]; EP, 0.34 [0.15-0.53]), lower sleep efficiency (SMD [95% CI]: pooled cases, −0.75 [−0.98 to −0.52]; EP, −0.90 [−1.20 to −0.60]; CP, −0.73 [−1.14 to −0.33]), and lower rapid eye movement density (SMD [95% CI]: pooled cases, 0.37 [0.14-0.60]; CP, 0.4 [0.19-0.77]). Spindle parameter deficits included density (SMD [95% CI]: pooled cases, −1.06 [−1.50 to −0.63]; EP, −0.80 [−1.22 to −0.39]; CP, −1.39 [−2.05 to −0.74]; amplitude: pooled cases, −1.08 [−1.33 to −0.82]; EP, −0.86 [−1.24 to −0.47]; CP, −1.25 [−1.58 to −0.91]; and duration: pooled cases: −1.2 [−1.69 to −0.73]; EP, −0.71 [−1.08 to −0.34]; CP, −1.74 [−2.10 to −1.38]). Individuals with CP had more frequent arousals vs CHR-P (z = 2.24, P = .02) and reduced spindle duration vs EP (z = −3.91, P &lt; .001).In this systematic review and meta-analysis, sleep disturbances were found to be prevalent throughout the course of psychosis, and different psychosis stages showed both shared and distinct abnormalities in sleep quality, architecture, and spindles. These findings suggest that sleep should become a core clinical target and research domain from at-risk to early and chronic stages of psychosis.",

      "abstractNote": "Multimodal, higher-order sensory integration in decapod crustaceans occurs in local interneurons (parasol cells) within a structure in the lateral protocerebrum, the hemiellipsoid body, which is located dorsal to the terminal medulla. The hemiellipsoid body is targeted by projection neuron inputs by means of the olfactory globular tract from bilateral deutocerebral neuropils, the accessory lobes, which receive secondary visual, mechanosensory, and olfactory inputs. Parasol cell dendrites arborize extensively within the two neuropils of the hemiellipsoid body and possibly have some neurites within another neuropil at its base. The two neuropils of the hemiellipsoid body, neuropils I and II, are known to receive asymmetrical inputs from the contralateral and ipsilateral accessory lobes, and our current study addresses the question of the distribution of parasol cells within these two neuropils. Three anatomic methods were used to analyze this distribution: intracellular filling of cells with neurobiotin and visualization of the cells by using either a fluorescent or a peroxidase avidin conjugate, or placement of a fluorescent lipophilic tracer within a lobe of the hemiellipsoid body. All of these methods demonstrated that single parasol cells exclusively arborize within one of the two lobes of the hemiellipsoid body, but not in both lobes. Electrophysiological recordings from pairs of parasol cells with dendrites in the same or different lobes confirm a functional separation between neuropils I and II. Comparisons are made between insect and crustacean systems, emphasizing the inputs to the hemiellipsoid body and the mushroom body and similarities between extrinsic cells in insects and parasol cells in decapod crustaceans.",

      "abstractNote": "Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are defined by multiple internal vesicles enclosed within an outer, limiting membrane. MVBs have previously been quantified in neuronal cell bodies and in dendrites, but their frequencies and significance in axons are controversial. Despite lack of conclusive evidence, it is widely believed that MVBs are the primary organelle that carries neurotrophic factors in axons. Reliable information about axonal MVBs under physiological and pathological conditions is needed for a realistic assessment of their functional roles in neurons. We provide a quantitative ultrastructural analysis of MVBs in the normal postnatal rat hypoglossal nerve and under a variety of experimental conditions. MVBs were about 50 times less frequent in axons than in neuronal cell bodies or dendrites. Five distinct types of MVBs were distinguished in axons, based on MVB size, electron density, and size of internal vesicles. Although target manipulations did not significantly change MVBs in axons, dystrophic conditions such as delayed fixation substantially increased the number of axonal MVBs. Radiolabeled brain- and glial-cell derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF and GDNF) injected into the tongue did not accumulate during retrograde axonal transport in MVBs, as determined by quantitative ultrastructural autoradiography, and confirmed by analysis of quantum dot-labeled BDNF. We conclude that for axonal transport, neurotrophic factors utilize small vesicles or endosomes that can be inconspicuous at transmission electron microscopic resolution, rather than MVBs. Previous reports of axonal MVBs may be based, in part, on artificial generation of such organelles in axons due to dystrophic conditions. J. Comp. Neurol. 514:641–657, 2009. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

      "abstractNote": "Striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) potently inhibit the output neurons of the striatum and, as such, powerfully modulate action learning. Through electrical synaptic coupling, FSIs are theorized to temporally coordinate their activity. This has important implications for their ability to temporally summate inhibition on downstream striatal projection neurons. While some in vivo single-unit electrophysiological recordings of putative FSIs support coordinated firing, others do not. Moreover, it is unclear as to what aspect of action FSIs encode. To address this, we used in vivo calcium imaging of genetically identified FSIs in freely moving mice and applied machine learning analyses to decipher the relationship between FSI activity and movement. We report that FSIs exhibit ensemble activity that encodes the speed of action sub-components, including ambulation and head movements. These results suggest FSI population dynamics fit within a Hebbian model for ensemble inhibition of striatal output guiding action. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

      "abstractNote": "Allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5) represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for multiple CNS disorders. Chemically distinct mGlu5 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that interact with a common binding site can demonstrate biased allosteric agonism relative to the orthosteric agonist, DHPG, when comparing activity in signaling assays such as IP1 accumulation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/2) and iCa2+ mobilization. However, the structural basis for such biased agonism is not well understood. Therefore, we evaluated biased allosteric agonism mediated by four mGlu5 PAM-agonists from diverse chemical scaffolds (i.e., DPFE, VU0409551, VU29, and VU0424465) for three measures of mGlu5 activation (i.e., iCa2+ mobilization, IP1 accumulation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation) at eight single-point mutations within the common allosteric binding pocket of mGlu5. In particular, mGlu5 allosteric site mutations had differential effects on the intrinsic efficacy of mGlu5 PAMs for multiple signaling pathways. Specifically, a loss of agonism for iCa2+ mobilization was evident for DPFE and VU0409551 for most mutants, whereas IP1 accumulation and ERK phosphorylation were retained, albeit with reduced maximal responses. Additionally, bias profiles between iCa2+ mobilization and IP1/ERK pathways remained similar to wild type for most mutants. However, W784A and A809G mutants lost bias between IP1 accumulation and ERK phosphorylation for VU0424465, whereas a loss of bias between iCa2+ mobilization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was evident for F787A, S808A and A809G mutants. These data provide further insight into the structural requirements for allosteric agonism across multiple mGlu5-mediated signaling pathways. An understanding of mGlu5 biased agonism at a structural level may provide the foundation for rational structure-based design of biased allosteric ligands for the treatment of neurological disorders.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major socioeconomic burden on society, and current pharmacotherapeutic treatment options are inadequate. Aberrant alcohol use and seeking alters frontostriatal function. Methods: We performed genome-wide RNA sequencing and subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction and receptor binding validation in the caudate–putamen of human AUD samples to identify potential therapeutic targets. We then back-translated our top candidate targets into a rodent model of long-term alcohol consumption to assess concordance of molecular adaptations in the rat striatum. Finally, we adopted rat behavioral models of alcohol intake and seeking to validate a potential therapeutic target. Results: We found that G protein–coupled receptors were the top canonical pathway differentially regulated in individuals with AUD. The M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) was downregulated at the gene and protein levels in the putamen, but not in the caudate, of AUD samples. We found concordant downregulation of the M4 mAChR, specifically on dopamine D1 receptor–expressing medium spiny neurons in the rat dorsolateral striatum. Systemic administration of the selective M4 mAChR positive allosteric modulator, VU0467154, reduced home cage and operant alcohol self-administration, motivation to obtain alcohol, and cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking in rats. Local microinjections of VU0467154 in the rat dorsolateral striatum reduced alcohol self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. Conclusions: Collectively, these results identify the M4 mAChR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AUD and the D1 receptor–positive medium spiny neurons in the dorsolateral striatum as a key site mediating the actions of M4 mAChR in relation to alcohol consumption and seeking. © 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry",

The way in which local elevations of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration spread in space and time is key for the versatility of the signals. Ca2+ diffusion in the cytosol is hindered by its interaction with proteins that act as buffers. Depending on the concentrations and the kinetics of the interactions, there is a large range of values at which Ca2+ diffusion can proceed. Having reliable estimates of this range, particularly of its highest end, which corresponds to the ions free diffusion, is key to understand how the signals propagate. In this work, we present the first experimental results with which the Ca2+-free diffusion coefficient is directly quantified in the cytosol of living cells. By means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments performed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the ions can freely diffuse in the cytosol at a higher rate than previously thought.",

Neuronal sexual dimorphisms typically represent quantitative differences in cell number, gene expression, or other features, and it is unknown whether these dimorphisms control sex-typical behavior exclusively in one sex or in both sexes. The progesterone receptor (PR) controls female sexual behavior, and we find many sex differences in number, distribution, or projections of PR-expressing neurons in the adult mouse brain. Using a genetic strategy we developed, we have ablated one such dimorphic PR-expressing neuronal population located in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Ablation of these neurons in females greatly diminishes sexual receptivity. Strikingly, the corresponding ablation in males reduces mating and aggression. Our findings reveal the functions of a molecularly defined, sexually dimorphic neuronal population in the brain. Moreover, we show that sexually dimorphic neurons can control distinct sex-typical behaviors in both sexes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding neural representations of behavioral routines is critical for understanding complex behavior in health and disease. We demonstrate here that accentuated activity of striatal projection neurons (SPNs) at the beginning and end of such behavioral repertoires is a supraordinate representation specifically marking previously rewarded behavioral sequences independent of the individual movements making up the behavior. We recorded spike activity in the striatum and primary motor cortex as individual rats learned specific rewarded lever-press sequences, each one unique to a given rat. Motor cortical neurons mainly responded in relation to specific movements regardless of their sequence of occurrence. By contrast, striatal SPN populations in each rat fired preferentially at the initiation and termination of its acquired sequence. Critically, the SPNs did not exhibit this bracketing signal when the same rats performed unreinforced sequences containing the same sub-movements that were present in their acquired sequence. Thus, the SPN activity was specifically related to a given repetitively reinforced movement sequence. This striatal beginning-and-end activity did not appear to be dependent on motor cortical inputs. However, strikingly, simultaneously recorded fast-spiking striatal interneurons (FSIs) showed equally selective but inverse firing patterns: they fired in between the initiation and termination of the acquired sequences. These findings suggest that the striatum contains networks of neurons representing acquired sequences of behavior at a level of abstraction higher than that of the individual movements making up the sequence. We propose that such SPN-FSI networks of the striatum could underlie the acquisition of chunked behavioral units. Habitual behavioral routines acquired by repetition are ubiquitous in daily life. Martiros et al. demonstrate that such learned habits and skills become marked as behavioral units, regardless of their movement content, by intrastriatal neuronal networks. After learning, this neuronal signal is not strongly dependent on motor cortex. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstractNote": "Glutamate receptors are the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, responsible for mediating the vast majority of excitatory transmission in neuronal networks. The AMPA- and NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate the fast synaptic responses, while metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are coupled to downstream signaling cascades that act on much slower timescales. These functionally distinct receptor sub-types are co-expressed at individual synapses, allowing for the precise temporal modulation of postsynaptic excitability and plasticity. Intriguingly, these receptors are differentially distributed with respect to the presynaptic release site. While iGluRs are enriched in the core of the synapse directly opposing the release site, mGluRs reside preferentially at the border of the synapse. As such, to understand the differential contribution of these receptors to synaptic transmission, it is important to not only consider their signaling properties, but also the mechanisms that control the spatial segregation of these receptor types within synapses. In this review, we will focus on the mechanisms that control the organization of glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic membrane with respect to the release site, and discuss how this organization could regulate synapse physiology.",

Behavioral and neurobiological analysis of this construct, with evidence from both animal and human studies, defines several dissociable forms depending on distinct cortico-striatal substrates. One form of impulsivity depends on the temporal discounting of reward, another on motor or response disinhibition. Impulsivity is commonly associated with addiction to drugs from different pharmacological classes, but its causal role in human addiction is unclear. We characterize in neurobehavioral and neurochemical terms a rodent model of impulsivity based on premature responding in an attentional task. Evidence is surveyed that high impulsivity on this task precedes the escalation subsequently of cocaine self-administration behavior, and also a tendency toward compulsive cocaine-seeking and to relapse. These results indicate that the vulnerability to stimulant addiction may depend on an impulsivity endophenotype. Implications of these findings for the etiology, development, and treatment of drug addiction are considered. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

The population of mRNAs that are localized to dendrites, however, remains sparsely identified. Here, we use deep sequencing to identify the mRNAs resident in the synaptic neuropil in the hippocampus. Analysis of a neuropil data set yielded a list of 8,379 transcripts of which 2,550 are localized in dendrites and/or axons. Using a fluorescent barcode strategy to label individual mRNAs, we show that their relative abundance in the neuropil varies over 3 orders of magnitude. High-resolution in situ hybridization validated the presence of mRNAs in both cultured neurons and hippocampal slices. Among the many mRNAs identified, we observed a large fraction of known synaptic proteins including signaling molecules, scaffolds and receptors. These results reveal a previously unappreciated enormous potential for the local protein synthesis machinery to supply, maintain and modify the dendritic and synaptic proteome.\nVideo Abstract",

Gαs signaling stimulates PKA activity, whereas Gαi inhibits PKA activity. Gαq, on the other hand, signals through phospholipase C, and it remains unclear whether Gαq-coupled receptors signal to PKA in their native context. Here, using two independent optical reporters of PKA activity in acute mouse hippocampus slices, we show that endogenous Gαq-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors activate PKA. Mechanistically, this effect is mediated by parallel signaling via either calcium or protein kinase C. Furthermore, multiple Gαq-coupled receptors modulate phosphorylation by PKA, a classical Gαs/Gαi effector. Thus, these results highlight PKA as a biochemical integrator of three major types of GPCRs and necessitate reconsideration of classic models used to predict neuronal signaling in response to the large family of Gαq-coupled receptors.",

      "abstractNote": "Processing in cortical circuits is driven by combinations of cortical and subcortical inputs. These inputs are often conceptually categorized as bottom-up, conveying sensory information, and top-down, conveying contextual information. Using intracellular recordings in mouse primary visual cortex, we measured neuronal responses to visual input, locomotion, and visuomotor mismatches. We show that layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons compute a difference between top-down motor-related input and bottom-up visual flow input. Most L2/3 neurons responded to visuomotor mismatch with either hyperpolarization or depolarization, and the size of this response was correlated with distinct physiological properties. Consistent with a subtraction of bottom-up and top-down input, visual and motor-related inputs had opposing influence on L2/3 neurons. In infragranular neurons, we found no evidence of a difference computation and responses were consistent with positive integration of visuomotor inputs. Our results provide evidence that L2/3 functions as a bidirectional comparator of top-down and bottom-up input.",

However, how this cellular diversity relates to the different hippocampal network computations that support memory-guided behavior is not yet known. We show that the anatomical identity of pyramidal cells is a major organizing principle of CA1 assembly dynamics, the emergence of memory replay, and cortical projection patterns in rats. Segregated pyramidal cell subpopulations encoded trajectory and choice-specific information or tracked changes in reward configuration respectively, and their activity was selectively read out by different cortical targets. Furthermore, distinct hippocampo-cortical assemblies coordinated the reactivation of complementary memory representations. These findings reveal the existence of specialized hippocampo-cortical subcircuits and provide a cellular mechanism that supports the computational flexibility and memory capacities of these structures.",

Neurons with both negative and positive prediction error response properties have been identified in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, but whether they correspond to transcriptionally defined subpopulations is unclear. Here we used the activity-dependent, photoconvertible marker CaMPARI2 to tag neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex during stimuli and behaviors designed to evoke prediction errors. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on these populations and found that previously annotated Adamts2 and Rrad layer 2/3 transcriptional cell types were enriched when photolabeling during stimuli that drive negative or positive prediction error responses, respectively. Finally, we validated these results functionally by designing artificial promoters for use in AAV vectors to express genetically encoded calcium indicators. Thus, transcriptionally distinct cell types in layer 2/3 that can be targeted using AAV vectors exhibit distinguishable negative and positive prediction error responses.",

      "abstractNote": "How do antidepressants elicit an antidepressant response? Here, we review accumulating evidence that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serves as a transducer, acting as the link between the antidepressant drug and the neuroplastic changes that result in the improvement of the depressive symptoms. Over the last decade several studies have consistently highlighted BDNF as a key player in antidepressant action. An increase in hippocampal and cortical expression of BDNF mRNA parallels the antidepressant-like response of conventional antidepressants such as SSRIs. Subsequent studies showed that a single bilateral infusion of BDNF into the ventricles or directly into the hippocampus is sufficient to induce a relatively rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effect. Importantly, the antidepressant-like response to conventional antidepressants is attenuated in mice where the BDNF signaling has been disrupted by genetic manipulations. Low dose ketamine, which has been found to induce a rapid antidepressant effect in patients with treatment-resistant depression, is also dependent on increased BDNF signaling. Ketamine transiently increases BDNF translation in hippocampus, leading to enhanced synaptic plasticity and synaptic strength. Ketamine has been shown to increase BDNF translation by blocking NMDA receptor activity at rest, thereby inhibiting calcium influx and subsequently halting eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase leading to a desuppression of protein translation, including BDNF translation. The antidepressant-like response of ketamine is abolished in BDNF and TrkB conditional knockout mice, eEF2 kinase knockout mice, in mice carrying the BDNF met/met allele, and by intra-cortical infusions of BDNF-neutralizing antibodies. In summary, current data suggests that conventional antidepressants and ketamine mediate their antidepressant-like effects by increasing BDNF in forebrain regions, in particular the hippocampus, making BDNF an essential determinant of antidepressant efficacy.",

We describe their influence in each of the major glutamate receptor subtypes: AMPARs, NMDARs, KARs and mGluRs. Particular emphasis is placed on how their work impacted our own studies in the hippocampus. For example, we describe how the tools and regulators that they identified for studying NMDARs (e.g., NMDA, D-AP5 and Mg2+) led to the understanding of the molecular basis of the induction of LTP. We also describe how other tools that they introduced (e.g., (1S,3R)-ACPD and MCPG) helped lead to the concept of metaplasticity.

      "abstractNote": "Because of intrinsic differences between humans and mice, no single mouse model can represent all features of a complex human trait such as alcoholism. It is therefore necessary to develop partial models. One important feature is drinking to the point where blood ethanol concentration (BEC) reaches levels that have measurable affects on physiology and/or behavior (>1.0 mg ethanol/ml blood). Most models currently in use examine relative oral self-administration from a bottle containing alcohol versus one containing water (two-bottle preference drinking), or oral operant self-administration. In these procedures, it is not clear when or if the animals drink to pharmacologically significant levels because the drinking is episodic and often occurs over a 24-h period. The aim of this study was to identify the optimal parameters and evaluate the reliability of a very simple procedure, taking advantage of a mouse genotype (C57BL/6J) that is known to drink large quantities of ethanol. We exchanged for the water bottle a solution containing ethanol in tap water for a limited period, early in the dark cycle, in the home cage. Mice regularly drank sufficient ethanol to achieve BEC>1.0 mg ethanol/ml blood. The concentration of ethanol offered (10%, 20% or 30%) did not affect consumption in g ethanol/kg body weight. The highest average BEC (∼1.6 mg/ml) occurred when the water-to-ethanol switch occurred 3 h into the dark cycle, and when the ethanol was offered for 4 rather than 2 h. Ethanol consumption was consistent within individual mice, and reliably predicted BEC after the period of ethanol access. C57BL/6J mice from three sources provided equivalent data, while DBA/2J mice drank much less than C57BL/6J in this test. We discuss advantages of the model for high-throughput screening assays where the goal is to find other genotypes of mice that drink excessively, or to screen drugs for their efficacy in blocking excessive drinking. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

      "abstractNote": "Memory is composed of various phases including cellular consolidation, systems consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction. In the last few years it has been shown that simple association memories can be encoded by a subset of the neuronal population called engram cells. Activity of these cells is necessary and sufficient for the recall of association memory. However, it is unclear which molecular mechanisms allow cellular engrams to encode the diverse phases of memory. Further research is needed to examine the possibility that it is the synapses between engram cells (the synaptic engram) that constitute the memory. In this review we summarize recent findings on cellular engrams with a focus on different phases of memory, and discuss the distinct molecular mechanism required for cellular and synaptic engrams.",

      "abstractNote": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent a potentially valuable cell source for applications in cell replacement therapy, drug development, and disease modeling. For all these uses, it is necessary to develop reproducible and robust protocols for differentiation into desired cell types. However, differentiation protocols remain unstable and inefficient, which makes minimizing the differentiation variance among hPSC lines and obtaining purified terminally differentiated cells extremely time consuming. Here, we report a simple treatment with three small molecules—SB431542, dorsomorphine, and CHIR99021—that enhanced hPSC differentiation into three germ layers with a chemically transitional embryoid-body-like state (CTraS). Induction of CTraS reduced the innate differentiation propensities of hPSCs (even unfavorably differentiated hPSCs) and shifted their differentiation into terminally differentiated cells, particularly neurons. In addition, CTraS induction accelerated in vitro pathological expression concurrently with neural maturation. Thus, CTraS can promote the latent potential of hPSCs for differentiation and potentially expand the utility and applicability of hPSCs.",

The coordination of these actions must occur without fault to prevent fatal blockages of the airway. Deciphering the neuronal circuitry that controls even a single action requires understanding the integration of sensory feedback and executive commands. A far greater challenge is to understand the coordination of multiple actions. Here, we focus on brainstem circuits that drive rhythmic orofacial actions. We discuss three neural computational mechanisms that may enable circuits for different actions to operate without interfering with each other. We conclude with proposed experimental programs for delineating the neural control principles that have evolved to coordinate orofacial behaviors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

Without known endogenous ligands, they have long been referred to as ‘orphan’ and remained enigmatic functionally. Recent progress has, however, radically changed this view. Both GluD receptors are expressed in wider brain regions than originally thought. Human genetic studies and analyses of knockout mice have revealed their involvement in multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The discovery of endogenous ligands, together with structural investigations, has opened the way towards a mechanistic understanding of GluD signaling at central nervous system synapses. These studies have also prompted the hypothesis that all iGluRs, and potentially other neurotransmitter receptors, rely on the cooperative binding of extracellular small-molecule and protein ligands for physiological signaling.",

      "abstractNote": "Both sexes of C57BL/6 (C57) mice consumed substantial quantities of ethanol without food or water deprivation whether access was continuous or limited. Food deprivation increased the amount of ethanol consumed, and the amount consumed depended upon when the animals were tested with reference to their daily food allotment. Ethanol consumption was greater if the mice were tested postprandially, high thirst motivation, rather than preprandially (∼10 vs. ∼4.5 g/kg/30 min). Preference for ethanol over water, however, was greater when mice were under low thirst motivation (i.e., tested preprandially or with water available during the test). Compared to males, female mice consumed more of a high-ethanol concentration solution (10%) when access was continuous or limited to the first hour of the dark (active) phase of the circadian cycle. Also, in contrast to males, female mice exhibited increased ethanol consumption across days of drinking experience. Finally, although ethanol consumption under the food deprivation conditions of this experiment did not differ according to sex, females had higher blood ethanol concentrations than male C57 mice, a finding not previously reported for rodents but common to humans.",

Proper initiation and termination of each action sequence is critical for the organization of behaviour, and is compromised in nigrostriatal disorders like Parkinsonĝ€™s and Huntingtonĝ€™s diseases. Using a self-paced operant task in which mice learn to perform a particular sequence of actions to obtain an outcome, we found neural activity in nigrostriatal circuits specifically signalling the initiation or the termination of each action sequence. This start/stop activity emerged during sequence learning, was specific for particular actions, and did not reflect interval timing, movement speed or action value. Furthermore, genetically altering the function of striatal circuits disrupted the development of start/stop activity and selectively impaired sequence learning. These results have important implications for understanding the functional organization of actions and the sequence initiation and termination impairments observed in basal ganglia disorders. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

      "abstractNote": "The specification and adaptability of cells rely on changes in protein composition. Nonetheless, uncovering proteome dynamics with cell-type-specific resolution remains challenging. Here we introduce a strategy for cell-specific analysis of newly synthesized proteomes by combining targeted expression of a mutated methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) with bioorthogonal or fluorescent non-canonical amino-acid-tagging techniques (BONCAT or FUNCAT). Substituting leucine by glycine within the MetRS-binding pocket (MetRSLtoG) enables incorporation of the non-canonical amino acid azidonorleucine (ANL) instead of methionine during translation. Newly synthesized proteins can thus be labelled by coupling the azide group of ANL to alkyne-bearing tags through 'click chemistry'. To test these methods for applicability in vivo, we expressed MetRSLtoG cell specifically in Drosophila. FUNCAT and BONCAT reveal ANL incorporation into proteins selectively in cells expressing the mutated enzyme. Cell-type-specific FUNCAT and BONCAT, thus, constitute eligible techniques to study protein synthesis-dependent processes in complex and behaving organisms.",

      "abstractNote": "The striatum is required for the acquisition of procedural memories, but its contribution to motor control once learning has occurred is unclear. We created a task in which rats learned a difficult motor sequence characterized by fine-tuned changes in running speed adjusted to spatial and temporal constraints. After training and extensive practice, we found that the behavior was habitual, yet tetrode recordings in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) revealed continuous integrative representations of running speed, position and time. These representations were weak in naive rats that were hand-guided to perform the same sequence and developed slowly after learning. Finally, DLS inactivation in well-trained animals preserved the structure of the sequence while increasing its trial-by-trial variability. We conclude that, after learning, the DLS continuously integrates task-relevant information to constrain the execution of motor habits. Our results provide a straightforward mechanism by which the basal ganglia may contribute to habit formation and motor control. © 2015 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.",

Here we provide evidence that a consequence of mGluR activation in the hippocampus is the rapid loss of both AMPA and NMDA receptors from synapses. Like mGluR-LTD, the stable expression of this change requires protein synthesis. These data suggest that expression of mGluR-LTD is at least partly postsynaptic, and that a functional consequence of dendritic protein synthesis is the regulation of glutamate receptor trafficking.",

      "abstractNote": "The acute effects of ethanol on the neurons of the striatum, a basal ganglia nucleus crucially involved in motor control and action selection, were investigated using whole-cell recordings. An intoxicating concentration of ethanol (50 mM) produced inhibitory effects on striatal large aspiny cholinergic interneurons (LAIs) and low-threshold spike interneurons (LTSIs). These effects persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin and were because of an increase in potassium currents, including those responsible for medium and slow afterhyperpolarizations. In contrast, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) were directly excited by ethanol, which depolarized these neurons through the suppression of potassium currents. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) became hyperpolarized in the presence of ethanol, but this effect did not persist in the presence of tetrodotoxin and was mimicked and occluded by application of the M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist telenzepine. Ethanol effects on MSNs were also abolished by 100 M barium. This showed that the hyperpolarizations observed in MSNs were because of decreased tonic activation of M1 muscarinic receptors, resulting in an increase in Kir2 conductances. Evoked GABAergic responses of MSNs were reversibly decreased by ethanol with no change in paired-pulse ratio. Furthermore, ethanol impaired the ability of thalamostriatal inputs to inhibit a subsequent corticostriatal glutamatergic response in MSNs. These results offer the first comprehensive description of the highly cell type-specific effects of ethanol on striatal neurons and provide a cellular basis for the interpretation of ethanol influence on a brain area crucially involved in the motor and decisional impairment caused by this drug. © 2011 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

      "abstractNote": "There are well-established links between impulsivity and alcohol use in humans and animal models; however, whether exaggerated impulsivity is a premorbid risk factor or a consequence of alcohol intake remains unclear. In a first approach, human young (18-25 years) social binge and non-binge drinkers were tested for motor impulsivity and attentional abilities in a human version of the Five-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (Sx-5CSRTT), modeled on the rodent 5CSRTT. Participants completed four variants of the Sx-5CSRT, in addition to being screened for impulsive traits (BIS-11 questionnaire) and impulsive behavior (by means of the Delay Discounting Questionnaire, Two-Choice Impulsivity Paradigm (TCIP), Stop Signal Reaction Time, and Time Estimation Task). Using a second approach, we compared one of these impulsivity measures, 5CSRTT performance, in two inbred strains of mice known to differ in alcohol intake. Compared with non-bingers (NBD; n=22), binge drinkers (BD, n=22) showed robust impairments in attention and premature responding when evaluated under increased attentional load, in addition to presenting deficits in decision making using the TCIP. The best predictors for high binge drinking score were premature responding in the Sx-5CSRTT, trait impulsivity in the BIS-11, and decision making in the TCIP. Alcohol-naïve C57BL/6J (B6) mice (alcohol preferring) were more impulsive in the 5CSRTT than DBA2/J (D2) mice (alcohol averse); the degree of impulsivity correlated with subsequent alcohol consumption. Homologous measures in animal and human studies indicate increased premature responding in young social BD and in the ethanol-preferring B6 strain of mice.",

Across species, alcohol exposure disinhibits the DLS by dampening GABAergic transmission onto this structure's principal medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs), providing a potential mechanistic basis for habitual alcohol drinking. However, the molecular and circuit components underlying this disinhibition remain unknown. To examine this, we used a combination of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and optogenetics to demonstrate that ethanol potently depresses both MSN- and fast-spiking interneuron (FSI)-MSN GABAergic synaptic transmission in the DLS. Concentrating on the powerfully inhibitory FSI-MSN synapse, we further show that acute exposure of ethanol (50 mM) to striatal slices activates delta opioid receptors that reside on FSI axon terminals and negatively couple to adenylyl cyclase to induce a long-term depression of GABA release onto both direct and indirect pathway MSNs. These findings elucidate a mechanism through which ethanol may globally disinhibit the DLS. © 2016 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "Allosteric ligands interact with binding sites on the receptor molecule that are topographically distinct from the binding site for the endogenous agonist (the orthosteric site).Allosteric modulators have at least three general advantages over standard orthosteric drugs:First, there is a 'ceiling' to their effect; once the allosteric sites are completely occupied, no further allosteric effect is observed.Second, they have the ability to selectively modify responses only in tissues in which the endogenous agonist is active.Third, they offer the potential for greater subtype selectivity, owing to greater variation in allosteric sites relative to orthosteric sites, and/or different degrees of allosteric modulation at each receptor subtype.Traditional radioligand binding assays, which use a radiolabelled 'probe' ligand to directly monitor occupancy of the orthosteric site on the receptor, are biased towards the detection of orthosteric effects. This could explain the current paucity of clinically available allosteric drugs.As radioligand binding assays are inherently probe dependent, discovery programmes that are specifically aimed at identifying allosteric modulators using such assays should, if possible, use the endogenous orthosteric ligand as a probe. Radioligand concentrations might need to be optimized to maximize the chance of detecting allosteric effects, and additional validation assays to monitor radioligand dissociation rates are also useful.Functional assays directly determine the desired physiological end point, and so are highly suitable for the detection of allosteric modulators. Potential disadvantages, such as a higher hit rate owing to activation of non-target receptors, could be offset by using radioligand binding as a secondary screen.",

      "abstractNote": "Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles of endocytic origin, which are released by cells and are accessible in biofluids, such as saliva, urine, and plasma. These vesicles are enriched with small RNA, and they play a role in many physiological processes. In the brain, they are involved in processes including synaptic plasticity, neuronal stress response, cell-to-cell communication and neurogenesis. While exosomes have been implicated previously in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, research regarding their role in mental disorders remains scarce. Given their functional significance in the brain, investigation in this field is warranted. Additionally, because exosomes can cross the blood–brain barrier, they may serve as accessible biomarkers of neural dysfunction. Studying exosomes may provide information towards diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, and specifically those derived from the brain may provide a mechanistic view of the disease phenotype. This review will discuss the roles of exosomes in the brain, and relate novel findings to current insights into mental disorders.",

      "abstractNote": "Synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis is mediated by SNARE proteins. Reconstituted SNAREs are constitutively active, so a major focus has been to identify fusion clamps that regulate their activity in synapses: the primary candidates are synaptotagmin (syt) 1 and complexin I/II. Syt1 is a Ca2+ sensor for SV release that binds Ca2+ via tandem C2-domains, C2A and C2B. Here, we first determined whether these C2-domains execute distinct functions. Remarkably, the C2B domain profoundly clamped all forms of SV fusion, despite synchronizing residual evoked release and rescuing the readily-releasable pool. Release was strongly enhanced by an adjacent C2A domain, and by the concurrent binding of complexin to trans-SNARE complexes. Knockdown of complexin had no impact on C2B-mediated clamping of fusion.

      "abstractNote": "The idea that predictions shape how we perceive and comprehend the world has become increasingly influential in the field of systems neuroscience. It also forms an important framework for understanding neuropsychiatric disorders, which are proposed to be the result of disturbances in the mechanisms through which prior information influences perception and belief, leading to the production of suboptimal models of the world. There is a widespread tendency to conceptualize the influence of predictions exclusively in terms of ‘top-down’ processes, whereby predictions generated in higher-level areas exert their influence on lower-level areas within an information processing hierarchy. However, this excludes from consideration the predictive information embedded in the ‘bottom-up’ stream of information processing. We describe evidence for the importance of this distinction and argue that it is critical for the development of the predictive processing framework and, ultimately, for an understanding of the perturbations that drive the emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and experiences.",

      "abstractNote": "The past decade of progress in neurobiology has uncovered important organizational principles for network preconfiguration and neuronal selection that suggest a generative grammar exists in the brain. In this Perspective, I discuss the competence of the hippocampal neural network to generically express temporally compressed sequences of neuronal firing that represent novel experiences, which is envisioned as a form of generative neural syntax supporting a neurobiological perspective on brain function. I compare this neural competence with the hippocampal network performance that represents specific experiences with higher fidelity after new learning during replay, which is envisioned as a form of neural semantic that supports a complementary neuropsychological perspective. I also demonstrate how the syntax of network competence emerges a priori during early postnatal life and is followed by the later development of network performance that enables rapid encoding and memory consolidation. Thus, I propose that this generative grammar of the brain is essential for internally generated representations, which are crucial for the cognitive processes underlying learning and memory, prospection, and inference, which ultimately underlie our reason and representation of the world.",

Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are frequently used for gene delivery, but targeting expression to specific cell types is an unsolved problem. We created a library of 230 AAVs, each with a different synthetic promoter designed using four independent strategies. We show that a number of these AAVs specifically target expression to neuronal and glial cell types in the mouse and non-human primate retina in vivo and in the human retina in vitro. We demonstrate applications for recording and stimulation, as well as the intersectional and combinatorial labeling of cell types. These resources and approaches allow economic, fast and efficient cell-type targeting in a variety of species, both for fundamental science and for gene therapy.",

      "abstractNote": "Learned associations between stimuli in different sensory modalities can shape the way we perceive these stimuli. However, it is not well understood how these interactions are mediated or at what level of the processing hierarchy they occur. Here we describe a neural mechanism by which an auditory input can shape visual representations of behaviorally relevant stimuli through direct interactions between auditory and visual cortices in mice. We show that the association of an auditory stimulus with a visual stimulus in a behaviorally relevant context leads to experience-dependent suppression of visual responses in primary visual cortex (V1). Auditory cortex axons carry a mixture of auditory and retinotopically matched visual input to V1, and optogenetic stimulation of these axons selectively suppresses V1 neurons that are responsive to the associated visual stimulus after, but not before, learning. Our results suggest that cross-modal associations can be communicated by long-range cortical connections and that, with learning, these cross-modal connections function to suppress responses to predictable input.",

      "abstractNote": "Selective elimination of synaptic connections is a common phenomenon which occurs during both developmental and pathological conditions. Glial cells have a central role in the pruning of synapses by specifically engulfing the degenerating neurites of inappropriate connections, but its regulatory mechanisms have been largely unknown. To identify mediators of this process, we established an in vitro cell culture assay for the synapse elimination. Neuronal differentiation and synapse formation of PC12 cells were induced by culturing the cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) in a serum-free medium. To trigger synapse elimination, the NGF-containing medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS and the neurites of PC12 cells degenerated within two days. Co-culturing with MG6 cells, a mouse microglial cell line, accelerated the removal of degenerating neurites of PC12 cells by phagocytosis. When MG6 cells were pre-incubated with exosomes secreted from the differentiated PC12 cells after depolarization, the removal was further accelerated by increasing the expression levels of complement component 3 in the MG6 cells. These results define a role for exosomes as a regulator of synapse elimination and clarify a novel mechanism whereby active synapses promote the pruning of inactive ones by stimulating microglial phagocytosis with exosomes.",

      "abstractNote": "Cells release nano-sized membrane vesicles that are involved in intercellular communication by transferring biological information between cells. It is generally accepted that cells release at least three types of extracellular vesicles (EVs): apoptotic bodies, microvesicles and exosomes. While a wide range of putative biological functions have been attributed to exosomes, they are assumed to represent a homogenous population of EVs. We hypothesized the existence of subpopulations of exosomes with defined molecular compositions and biological properties. Density gradient centrifugation of isolated exosomes revealed the presence of two distinct subpopulations, differing in biophysical properties and their proteomic and RNA repertoires. Interestingly, the subpopulations mediated differential effects on the gene expression programmes in recipient cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that cells release distinct exosome subpopulations with unique compositions that elicit differential effects on recipient cells. Further dissection of exosome heterogeneity will advance our understanding of exosomal biology in health and disease and accelerate the development of exosome-based diagnostics and therapeutics.",

      "abstractNote": "Substance dependence is characterized by compulsive drug-taking despite negative consequences. Animal research suggests an underlying imbalance between goal-directed and habitual action control with chronic drug use. However, this imbalance, and its associated neurophysiological mechanisms, has not yet been experimentally investigated in human drug abusers. The aim of the present study therefore was to assess the balance between goal-directed and habit-based learning and its neural correlates in abstinent alcohol-dependent (AD) patients. A total of 31 AD patients and 19 age, gender and education matched healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during completion of an instrumental learning task designed to study the balance between goal-directed and habit learning. Task performance and task-related blood oxygen level-dependent activations in the brain were compared between AD patients and healthy matched controls. Findings were additionally associated with duration and severity of alcohol dependence. The results of this study provide evidence for an overreliance on stimulusresponse habit learning in AD compared with HC, which was accompanied by decreased engagement of brain areas implicated in goal-directed action (ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior putamen) and increased recruitment of brain areas implicated in habit learning (posterior putamen) in AD patients. In conclusion, this is the first human study to provide experimental evidence for a disturbed balance between goal-directed and habitual control by use of an instrumental learning task, and to directly implicate cortical dysfunction to overreliance on inflexible habits in AD patients. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "Metabotropic glutamate receptors belong to class C G-protein-coupled receptors and consist of eight subtypes that are ubiquitously expressed throughout the central nervous system. In recent years, the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5) has emerged as a promising target for a broad range of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Drug discovery programs targetting mGlu5 are primarily focused on development of allosteric modulators that interact with sites distinct from the endogenous agonist glutamate. Significant efforts have seen mGlu5 allosteric modulators progress into clinical trials; however, recent failures due to lack of efficacy or adverse effects indicate a need for a better understanding of the functional consequences of mGlu5 allosteric modulation. Biased agonism is an interrelated phenomenon to allosterism, describing how different ligands acting through the same receptor can differentially influence signaling to distinct transducers and pathways. Emerging evidence demonstrates that allosteric modulators can induce biased pharmacology at the level of intrinsic agonism as well as through differential modulation of orthosteric agonist-signaling pathways. Here, we present key considerations in the discovery and development of mGlu5 allosteric modulators and the opportunities and pitfalls offered by biased agonism and modulation.",

The selective identification of a newly synthesized proteome has been hindered by the basic fact that all proteins, new and old, share the same pool of amino acids and thus are chemically indistinguishable. We describe here a technology, based on the cotranslational introduction of azide groups into proteins and the chemoselective tagging of azide-labeled proteins with an alkyne affinity tag, to separate and identify, specifically, the newly synthesized proteins in mammalian cells. Incorporation of the azide-bearing amino acid azidohomoalanine is unbiased, not toxic, and does not increase protein degradation. As a first demonstration of the method, we report the selective purification and identification of 195 metabolically labeled proteins with multidimensional liquid chromatography in-line with tandem MS. Furthermore, in combination with leucine-based mass tagging, candidates were immediately validated as newly synthesized proteins. The identified proteins, synthesized in a 2-h window, possess a broad range of biochemical properties and span most functional gene ontology categories. This technology makes it possible to address the temporal and spatial characteristics of newly synthesized proteomes in any cell type.",

The investigation of these processes requires measurements of task-evoked neuronal activities from large numbers of neurons over many days. Here, we present a two-photon imaging-based system to track event–related neuronal activity in thousands of neurons through the quantitative measurement of EGFP proteins expressed under the control of the EGR1 gene promoter. A recognition algorithm was developed to detect GFP-positive neurons in multiple cortical volumes and thereby to allow the reproducible tracking of 4,000 neurons in each volume for 2 mo. The analysis revealed a context-specific response in sparse layer II neurons. The context-evoked response gradually increased during several days of training and was maintained 1 mo later. The formed traces were specifically activated by the training context and were linearly correlated with the behavioral response. Neuronal assemblies that responded to specific contexts were largely separated, indicating the sparse coding of memory-related traces in the layer II cortical circuit.",

      "abstractNote": "Functional characterization of the GPCR interactome has been focused predominantly on intracellular interactions, yet GPCRs are increasingly found in complex with extracellular proteins. Extracellular leucine-rich repeat fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (ELFN1) was recently reported to physically anchor mGluR6 and mGluR7 across retinal and hippocampal synapses, respectively; however, the consequence of transsynaptic interactions on properties and pharmacology of these receptors are unknown. In the current study, we explore the effects of ELFN1 on mGluR signaling and pharmacology. First, we established the binding specificity of ELFN1 and found it to be recruited selectively to all group III mGluRs (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8), but not other mGluR species. Using site-directed mutagenesis we mapped binding determinants of this interaction to two distinct sites on the ELFN1 ectodomain. To evaluate functional aspects of the interaction, we developed a transcellular signaling assay in reconstituted HEK293 cells which monitors changes in mGluR activity in one cell following its exposure to separate ELFN1-containing cells. Using this platform, we found that ELFN1 acts as an allosteric modulator of class III mGluR activity in suppressing cAMP accumulation: altering both agonist-induced and constitutive receptor activity. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based real-time kinetic assays, we established that ELFN1 alters the ability of mGluRs to activate G proteins. Our findings demonstrate that core properties of class III mGluRs can be altered via extracellular interactions with ELFN1 which serves as a transsynaptic allosteric modulator for these receptors. Furthermore, our unique assay platform opens avenues for exploring transcellular/transsynaptic pharmacology of other GPCR transcomplexes.",

Nevertheless, this behavior does not appear to replicate the essential features of human alcoholism since the drinking lacks serious toxic effects and the intoxication occurs only as transient episodes in association with homeostatic consumption of fluid and food. It is suggested that continuous monitoring of intake and estimation of the concentration of alcohol in blood, which are now technically feasible, will permit distinction between alcoholic-type drinking and a simple licking for the flavor of alcohol in beverage concentration.",

Theoretical analysis combined with patch clamp recordings from pairs of neocortical pyramidal neurons revealed that the rate of synaptic depression, which depends on the probability of neurotransmitter release, dictates the extent to which firing rate and temporal coherence of action potentials within a presynaptic population are signaled to the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic response primarily reflects rates of firing when depression is slow and temporal coherence when depression is fast. A wide range of rates of synaptic depression between different pairs of pyramidal neurons was found, suggesting that the relative contribution of rate and temporal signals varies along a continuum. We conclude that by setting the rate of synaptic depression, release probability is an important factor in determining the neural code.",

      "abstractNote": "The nature of information stemming from a single neuron and conveyed simultaneously to several hundred target neurons is not known. Triple and quadruple neuron recordings revealed that each synaptic connection established by neocortical pyramidal neurons is potentially unique. Specifically, synaptic connections onto the same morphological class differed in the numbers and dendritic locations of synaptic contacts, their absolute synaptic strengths, as well as their rates of synaptic depression and recovery from depression. The same axon of a pyramidal neuron innervating another pyramidal neuron and an interneuron mediated frequency-dependent depression and facilitation, respectively, during high frequency discharges of presynaptic action potentials, suggesting that the different natures of the target neurons underlie qualitative differences in synaptic properties. Facilitating-type synaptic connections established by three pyramidal neurons of the same class onto a single interneuron, were all qualitatively similar with a combination of facilitation and depression mechanisms. The time courses of facilitation and depression, however, differed for these convergent connections, suggesting that different prepostsynaptic interactions underlie quantitative differences in synaptic properties. Mathematical analysis of the transfer functions of frequency-dependent synapses revealed supralinear, linear, and sub-linear signaling regimes in which mixtures of presynaptic rates, integrals of rates, and derivatives of rates are transferred to targets depending on the precise values of the synaptic parameters and the history of presynaptic action potential activity. Heterogeneity of synaptic transfer functions therefore allows multiple synaptic representations of the same presynaptic action potential train and suggests that these synaptic representations are regulated in a complex manner. It is therefore proposed that differential signaling is a key mechanism in neocortical information processing, which can be regulated by selective synaptic modifications.",

      "abstractNote": "The G protein-coupled receptor GHS-R1a mediates ghrelin-induced growth hormone secretion, food intake, and reward-seeking behaviors. GHS-R1a signals through Gq, Gi/o, G13, and arrestin. Biasing GHS-R1a signaling with specific ligands may lead to the development of more selective drugs to treat obesity or addiction with minimal side effects. To delineate ligand selectivity at GHS-R1a signaling, we analyzed in detail the efficacy of a panel of synthetic ligands activating the different pathways associated with GHS-R1a in HEK293T cells. Besides β-arrestin2 recruitment and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we monitored activation of a large panel of G protein subtypes using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assay with G protein-activation biosensors. We first found that unlike full agonists, Gq partial agonists were unable to trigger β-arrestin2 recruitment and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Using G protein-activation biosensors, we then demonstrated that ghrelin promoted activation of Gq, Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, Goa, Gob, and G13 but not Gs and G12. Besides, we identified some GHS-R1a ligands that preferentially activated Gq and antagonized ghrelin-mediated Gi/Go activation. Finally, we unambiguously demonstrated that in addition to Gq, GHS-R1a also promoted constitutive activation of G13. Importantly, we identified some ligands that were selective inverse agonists toward Gq but not of G13. This demonstrates that bias at GHS-R1a signaling can occur not only with regard to agonism but also to inverse agonism. Our data, combined with other in vivo studies, may facilitate the design of drugs selectively targeting individual signaling pathways to treat only the therapeutically relevant function.",

      "abstractNote": "Activity‐dependent local translation of dendritic mRNAs is one process that underlies synaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that several of the factors known to control polyadenylation‐induced translation in early vertebrate development [cytoplasmic polyadenylation element‐binding protein (CPEB), maskin, poly(A) polymerase, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and Aurora] also reside at synaptic sites of rat hippocampal neurons. The induction of polyadenylation at synapses is mediated by the N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which transduces a signal that results in the activation of Aurora kinase. This kinase in turn phosphorylates CPEB, an essential RNA‐binding protein, on a critical residue that is necessary for polyadenylation‐induced translation. These data demonstrate a remarkable conservation of the regulatory machinery that controls signal‐induced mRNA translation, and elucidates an axis connecting the NMDA receptor to localized protein synthesis at synapses.",

      "abstractNote": "Constitutive receptor activity/inverse agonism and functional selectivity/biased agonism are 2 concepts in contemporary pharmacology that have major implications for the use of drugs in medicine and research as well as for the processes of new drug development. Traditional receptor theory postulated that receptors in a population are quiescent unless activated by a ligand. Within this framework ligands could act as agonists with various degrees of intrinsic efficacy, or as antagonists with zero intrinsic efficacy. We now know that receptors can be active without an activating ligand and thus display “constitutive” activity. As a result, a new class of ligand was discovered that can reduce the constitutive activity of a receptor. These ligands produce the opposite effect of an agonist and are called inverse agonists. The second topic discussed is functional selectivity, also commonly referred to as biased agonism. Traditional receptor theory also posited that intrinsic efficacy is a single drug property independent of the system in which the drug acts. However, we now know that a drug, acting at a single receptor subtype, can have multiple intrinsic efficacies that differ depending on which of the multiple responses coupled to a receptor is measured. Thus, a drug can be simultaneously an agonist, an antagonist, and an inverse agonist acting at the same receptor. This means that drugs have an additional level of selectivity (signaling selectivity or “functional selectivity”) beyond the traditional receptor selectivity. Both inverse agonism and functional selectivity need to be considered when drugs are used as medicines or as research tools.",

By defining dysfunctional sleep architecture and rhythms in schizophrenia, we focus on the disarray of mechanisms critical to learning and memory and postulate an association between sleep disturbances and cognitive impairments in the disorder.

We aimed to provide the first detailed assessment of sleep disorders and their correlates in patients with early psychosis. Sixty outpatients aged between 18 and 30 with nonaffective psychosis were assessed for sleep disorder presence, severity, and treatment using a structured diagnostic interview, sleep diaries, and actigraphy. Psychotic experiences, mood, and psychological wellbeing were also measured. Forty-eight patients (80%) had at least one sleep disorder, with insomnia and nightmare disorder being the most common. Comorbidity of sleep disorders within this group was high, with an average of 3.3 sleep disorders per patient. Over half of the sleep disorders had been discussed with a clinician but almost three-quarters had received no treatment. Treatment according to clinical guidelines was rare, occurring in only 8% of cases (n = 13). Sleep disorders were significantly associated with increased psychotic experiences, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and lower quality of life. Sleep disorders are very common in patients with psychosis, may have wide-ranging negative effects, and merit routine assessment and treatment in psychiatric practice.",

      "abstractNote": "Goal-directed action involves making high-level choices that are implemented using previously acquired action sequences to attain desired goals. Such a hierarchical schema is necessary for goal-directed actions to be scalable to real-life situations, but results in decision-making that is less flexible than when action sequences are unfolded and the decision-maker deliberates step-by-step over the outcome of each individual action. In particular, from this perspective, the offline revaluation of any outcomes that fall within action sequence boundaries will be invisible to the high-level planner resulting in decisions that are insensitive to such changes. Here, within the context of a two-stage decision-making task, we demonstrate that this property can explain the emergence of habits. Next, we show how this hierarchical account explains the insensitivity of over-trained actions to changes in outcome value. Finally, we provide new data that show that, under extended extinction conditions, habitual behaviour can revert to goal-directed control, presumably as a consequence of decomposing action sequences into single actions. This hierarchical view suggests that the development of action sequences and the insensitivity of actions to changes in outcome value are essentially two sides of the same coin, explaining why these two aspects of automatic behaviour involve a shared neural structure. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

      "abstractNote": "Hebbian plasticity is widely considered to be the mechanism by which information can be coded and retained in neurons in the brain. Homeostatic plasticity moves the neuron back towards its original state following a perturbation, including perturbations produced by Hebbian plasticity. How then does homeostatic plasticity avoid erasing the Hebbian coded information? To understand how plasticity works in the brain, and therefore to understand learning, memory, sensory adaptation, development and recovery from injury, requires development of a theory of plasticity that integrates both forms of plasticity into a whole. In April 2016, a group of computational and experimental neuroscientists met in London at a discussion meeting hosted by the Royal Society to identify the critical questions in the field and to frame the research agenda for the next steps. Here, we provide a brief introduction to the papers arising from the meeting and highlight some of the themes to have emerged from the discussions., This article is part of the themed issue ‘Integrating Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity’.",

      "abstractNote": "Compulsive alcohol drinking, where intake persists regardless of adverse consequences, plays a major role in the substantial costs of alcohol use disorder. However, the processes that promote aversion-resistant drinking remain poorly understood. Compulsion-like responding has been considered automatic and reflexive and also to involve higher motivation, since drinking persists despite adversity. Thus, we used lickometry, where microstructural behavioral changes can reflect altered motivation, to test whether conflict-resistant intake [quinine-alcohol (QuiA)] reflected greater automaticity or motivation relative to alcohol-only drinking (Alc). Front-loading during QuiA and Alc suggested incentive to drink in both. However, the relationship between total licking and intake was less variable during QuiA, as was lick volume, without changes in average responding. QuiA bout organization was also less variable, with fewer licks outside of bouts (stray licks) and fewer gaps within bouts. Interestingly, QuiA avoidance of stray licking continued into short bouts, with fewer short and more medium-length bouts, which was striking given their minor impact on intake. Instead, more effort at bout onset could allow short bouts to persist longer. Indeed, while QuiA licking was overall faster, QuiA bouts were especially fast at bout initiation. However, few QuiA changes individually predicted greater intake, perhaps suggesting an overarching strategy during aversion-resistant responding. Thus, our results indicate that aversion-resistant intake exhibited less variability, where increased automaticity could decrease need for awareness, and stronger bout initiation, which might prolong responding despite adversity. This may reflect a collective strategy, which we call Head Down and Push responding that facilitates conflict-resistant, compulsion-like intake. © 2018 Society for the Study of Addiction",

      "abstractNote": "Background: Continued consumption of alcohol despite deleterious consequences is a hallmark of alcoholism and represents a critical challenge to therapeutic intervention. Previous rat studies showed that enduring alcohol self-administration despite pairing alcohol with normally aversive stimuli was only observed after very long-term intake (>8 months). Aversion-resistant alcohol intake has been previously interpreted to indicate pathological or compulsive motivation to consume alcohol. However, given the time required to model compulsive alcohol seeking in previous studies, there is considerable interest in developing more efficient and quantitative rodent models of aversion-resistant alcohol self-administration. Methods: Outbred Wistar rats underwent 3 to 4 months or approximately 1.5 months of intermittent, home-cage, two-bottle access (IAA) to 20% alcohol (v/v) or water. Then, after brief operant training, the effect of the bitter-tasting quinine (0.1 g/l) on the motivation to seek alcohol was quantified via progressive ratio (PR). Motivation for quinine-adulterated 2% sucrose under PR was assayed in a separate cohort of 3 to 4 months IAA rats. The effects of quinine on home-cage alcohol consumption in IAA rats and rats with continuous access to alcohol were also examined. Finally, a dose-response for quinine taste preference in IAA and continuous-access animals was determined. Results: Motivation for alcohol after 3 to 4 months IAA, measured using an operant PR procedure, was not altered by adulteration of alcohol with 0.1 g/l quinine. In contrast, after 3 to 4 months of IAA, motivation for sucrose under PR was significantly reduced by adulteration of sucrose with 0.1 g/l quinine. In addition, motivation for alcohol after only approximately 1.5 months IAA was significantly reduced by adulteration of alcohol with 0.1 g/l quinine. Furthermore, home-cage alcohol intake by IAA rats was insensitive to quinine at concentrations (0.01, 0.03 g/l) that significantly reduced alcohol drinking in animals with continuous access to alcohol. Finally, no changes in quinine taste preference after 3 to 4 months IAA or continuous access to alcohol were observed. Conclusions: We have developed a novel and technically simple hybrid operant/IAA model in which quinine-resistant motivation for alcohol is evident after an experimentally tractable period of time (3 to 4 months vs. 8 months). Quinine dramatically reduced sucrose and water intake by IAA rats, indicating that continued responding for alcohol in IAA rats despite adulteration with the normally aversive quinine might reflect maladaptive or compulsive motivation for alcohol. This model could facilitate identification of novel therapeutic interventions for pathological alcohol seeking in humans. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.",

These ensembles could be formed by Hebbian plasticity, whereby synapses between coactive neurons are strengthened. Here we report that repetitive activation with two-photon optogenetics of neuronal populations from ensembles in the visual cortex of awake mice builds neuronal ensembles that recur spontaneously after being imprinted and do not disrupt preexisting ones. Moreover, imprinted ensembles can be recalled by single- cell stimulation and remain coactive on consecutive days. Our results demonstrate the persistent reconfiguration of cortical circuits by two-photon optogenetics into neuronal ensembles that can perform pattern completion.",

The cellular and molecular events in the developing hippocampus that underlie the emergence of precise, episodic-like memory are unclear. In mice, the absence of a competitive neuronal engram allocation process in the immature hippocampus precluded the formation of sparse engrams and precise memories until the fourth postnatal week, when inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus mature. This age-dependent shift in precision of episodic-like memories involved the functional maturation of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in subfield CA1 through assembly of extracellular perineuronal nets, which is necessary and sufficient for the onset of competitive neuronal allocation, sparse engram formation, and memory precision.",

      "abstractNote": "Predictive processing is a computational framework that aims to explain how the brain processes sensory information by making predictions about the environment and minimizing prediction errors. It can also be used to explain some of the key symptoms of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. In recent years, substantial advances have been made in our understanding of the neuronal circuitry that underlies predictive processing in cortex. In this review, we summarize these findings and how they might relate to psychosis and to observed cell type–specific effects of antipsychotic drugs. We argue that quantifying the effects of antipsychotic drugs on specific neuronal circuit elements is a promising approach to understanding not only the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs but also psychosis. Finally, we outline some of the key experiments that should be done. The aims of this review are to provide an overview of the current circuit-based approaches to psychosis and to encourage further research in this direction.",

      "abstractNote": "A decade ago, we hypothesized that drug addiction can be viewed as a transition from voluntary, recreational drug use to compulsive drug-seeking habits, neurally underpinned by a transition from prefrontal cortical to striatal control over drug seeking and taking as well as a progression from the ventral to the dorsal striatum. Here, in the light of burgeoning, supportive evidence, we reconsider and elaborate this hypothesis, in particular the refinements in our understanding of ventral and dorsal striatal mechanisms underlying goal-directed and habitual drug seeking, the influence of drug-associated Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli on drug seeking and relapse, and evidence for impairments in top-down prefrontal cortical inhibitory control over this behavior. We further review animal and human studies that have begun to define etiological factors and individual differences in the propensity to become addicted to drugs, leading to the description of addiction endophenotypes, especially for cocaine addiction. We consider the prospect of novel treatments for addiction that promote abstinence from and relapse to drug use. Copyright © 2016 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "Scientists in many different fields have been attracted to the study of habits because of the power habits have over behavior and because they invoke a dichotomy between the conscious, voluntary control over behavior, considered the essence of higher-order deliberative behavioral control, and lower-order behavioral control that is scarcely available to consciousness. A broad spectrum of behavioral routines and rituals can become habitual and stereotyped through learning. Others have a strong innate basis. Repetitive behaviors can also appear as cardinal symptoms in a broad range of neurological and neuropsychiatric illness and in addictive states. This review suggests that many of these behaviors could emerge as a result of experience-dependent plasticity in basal ganglia-based circuits that can influence not only overt behaviors but also cognitive activity. Culturally based rituals may reflect privileged interactions between the basal ganglia and cortically based circuits that influence social, emotional, and action functions of the brain.

      "abstractNote": "Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a catastrophic injury that can cause irreversible motor dysfunction with high disability. Exosomes participate in the transport of miRNAs and play an essential role in intercellular communication via transfer of genetic material. However, the miRNAs in exosomes which derived from neurons, and the underlying mechanisms by which they contribute to SCI remain unknown. Methods: A contusive in vivo SCI model and a series of in vitro experiments were carried out to explore the therapeutic effects of exosomes. Then, a miRNA microarray analysis and rescue experiments were performed to confirm the role of neuron-derived exosomal miRNA in SCI. Western blot, luciferase activity assay, and RNA-ChIP were used to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Results: The results indicated that neuron-derived exosomes promoted functional behavioral recovery by suppressing the activation of M1 microglia and A1 astrocytes in vivo and in vitro. A miRNA array showed miR-124-3p to be the most enriched in neuron-derived exosomes. MYH9 was identified as the target downstream gene of miR-124-3p. A series of experiments were used to confirm the miR-124-3p/MYH9 axis. Finally, it was found that PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling cascades may be involved in the modulation of microglia by exosomal miR-124-3p. Conclusion: A combination of miRNAs and neuron-derived exosomes may be a promising, minimally invasive approach for the treatment of SCI. © 2020 The Author(s).",

We find that a dynamical feature dominates statistical descriptions of propagating activity for both neocortex and the model: convergent clusters comprised of fan-in triangle motifs, where two input neurons are themselves connected. Fan-in triangles coordinate the timing of presynaptic inputs during ongoing activity to effectively generate postsynaptic spiking. As a result, paradoxically, fan-in triangles dominate the statistics of spike propagation even in randomly connected recurrent networks. Interplay between higher-order synaptic connectivity and the integrative properties of neurons constrains the structure of network dynamics and shapes the routing of information in neocortex.",

      "abstractNote": "Synaptic transmission relies on several processes, such as the location of a released vesicle, the number and type of receptors, trafficking between the postsynaptic density (PSD) and extrasynaptic compartment, as well as the synapse organization. To study the impact of these parameters on excitatory synaptic transmission, we present a computational model for the fast AMPA-receptor mediated synaptic current. We show that in addition to the vesicular release probability, due to variations in their release locations and the AMPAR distribution, the postsynaptic current amplitude has a large variance, making a synapse an intrinsic unreliable device. We use our model to examine our experimental data recorded from CA1 mice hippocampal slices to study the differences between mEPSC and evoked EPSC variance. The synaptic current but not the coefficient of variation is maximal when the active zone where vesicles are released is apposed to the PSD. Moreover, we find that for certain type of synapses, receptor trafficking can affect the magnitude of synaptic depression. Finally, we demonstrate that perisynaptic microdomains located outside the PSD impacts synaptic transmission by regulating the number of desensitized receptors and their trafficking to the PSD. We conclude that geometrical modifications, reorganization of the PSD or perisynaptic microdomains modulate synaptic strength, as the mechanisms underlying long-term plasticity. © 2011 Freche et al.",

      "abstractNote": "The RNA that is packaged into exosomes is termed as exosomal-shuttle RNA (esRNA); however, the players, which take this subset of RNA (esRNA) into exosomes, remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) could serve as key players in this mechanism, by making complexes with RNAs and transporting them into exosomes during the biosynthesis of exosomes. Here, we demonstrate the presence of 30 RBPs in exosomes that were shown to form RNA–RBP complexes with both cellular RNA and exosomal-RNA species. To assess the involvement of these RBPs in RNA-transfer into exosomes, the gene transcripts encoding six of the proteins identified in exosomes (HSP90AB1, XPO5, hnRNPH1, hnRNPM, hnRNPA2B1, and MVP) were silenced by siRNA and subsequent effect on esRNA was assessed. A significant reduction of total esRNA was observed by post-transcriptional silencing of MVP, compared to other RBPs. Furthermore, to confirm the binding of MVP with esRNA, a biotinylated-MVP was transiently expressed in HEK293F cells. Higher levels of esRNA were recovered from MVP that was eluted from exosomes of transfected cells, as compared to those of non-transfected cells. Our data indicate that these RBPs could end up in exosomes together with RNA molecules in the form of RNA–ribonucleoprotein complexes, which could be important for the transport of RNAs into exosomes and the maintenance of RNAs inside exosomes. This type of maintenance may favor the shuttling of RNAs from exosomes to recipient cells in the form of stable complexes.",

      "abstractNote": "In a manner unique among activity-regulated immediate early genes (IEGs), mRNA encoded by Arc (also known as Arg3.1) undergoes rapid transport to dendrites and local synaptic translation. Despite this intrinsic appeal, relatively little is known about the neuronal and behavioral functions of Arc or its molecular mechanisms of action. Here, we attempt to distill recent advances on Arc spanning its transcriptional and translational regulation, the functions of the Arc protein in multiple forms of neuronal plasticity [long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and homeostatic plasticity], and its broader role in neural networks of behaving animals. Worley and colleagues have shown that Arc interacts with endophilin and dynamin, creating a postsynaptic trafficking endosome that selectively modifies the expression of AMPA-type glutamate receptors at the excitatory synapses. Both LTD and homeostatic plasticity in the hippocampus are critically dependent on Arc-mediated endocytosis of AMPA receptors. LTD evoked by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors depends on rapid Arc translation controlled by elongation factor 2. Bramham and colleagues have shown that sustained translation of newly induced Arc mRNA is necessary for cofilin phosphorylation and stable expansion of the F-actin cytoskeleton underlying LTP consolidation in the dentate gyrus of live rats. In addition to regulating F-actin, Arc synthesis maintains the activity of key translation factors during LTP consolidation. This process of Arc-dependent consolidation is activated by the secretory neurotrophin, BDNF. Moore and colleagues have shown that Arc mRNA is a natural target for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by virtue of its two conserved 3′-UTR introns. NMD and other related translation-dependent mRNA decay mechanisms may serve as critical brakes on protein expression that contribute to the fine spatial-temporal control of Arc synthesis. In studies in behaving rats, Guzowski and colleagues have shown that location-specific firing of CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons in the presence of theta rhythm provides the necessary stimuli for activation of Arc transcription. The impact of Arc transcription in memory processes may depend on the specific context of coexpressed IEGs, in addition to posttranscriptional regulation of Arc by neuromodulatory inputs from the amygdala and other brain regions. In sum, Arc is emerging as a versatile, finely tuned system capable of coupling changes in neuronal activity patterns to diverse forms of synaptic plasticity, thereby optimizing information storage in active networks.",

      "abstractNote": "Two forms of long-term depression (LTD), triggered by activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), respectively, can be induced at CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. Compared with NMDAR-LTD, relatively little is known about mGluR-LTD. Here, we show that protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors, orthovanadate and phenylarsine oxide, selectively block mGluR-LTD induced by application of the group I mGluR agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG-LTD), because NMDAR-LTD is unaffected by these inhibitors. Furthermore, DHPG-LTD measured using whole-cell recording is similarly blocked by either bath-applied or patch-loaded PTP inhibitors. These inhibitors also block the changes in paired-pulse facilitation and coefficient of variation that are associated with the expression of DHPG-LTD. DHPG treatment of hippocampal slices was associated with a decrease in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of GluR2 AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits, an effect blocked by orthovanadate. Finally, in dissociated hippocampal neurons, orthovanadate blocked the ability of DHPG to reduce the number of AMPA receptor clusters on the surface of dendrites. Again, the effects of PTP blockade were selective, because NMDA-induced decreases in surface AMPAR clusters was unaffected by orthovanadate. Together, these data suggest that activation of postsynaptic PTP results in tyrosine dephosphorylation of AMPARs and their removal from the synapse.",

The connectivity within this microcircuit is divided into two main categories: lateral connectivity between MSNs, and inhibition mediated by interneurons, in particular fast spiking (FS) cells. To understand the operation of striatum, it is essential to have a good description of the dynamic properties of these respective pathways and how they affect different types of striatal projection neurons.</p><p>We recorded from neuronal pairs, triplets, and quadruplets in slices of rat and mouse striatum and analyzed the dynamics of synaptic transmission between MSNs and FS cells. Retrograde fluorescent labeling and transgenic EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) mice were used to distinguish between MSNs of the direct (striatonigral) and indirect (striatopallidal) pathways. Presynaptic neurons were stimulated with trains of action potentials, and activity-dependent depression and facilitation of synaptic efficacy was recorded from postsynaptic neurons. We found that FS cells provide a strong and homogeneously depressing inhibition of both striatonigral and striatopallidal MSN types. Moreover, individual FS cells are connected to MSNs of both types. In contrast, both MSN types receive sparse and variable, depressing and facilitating synaptic transmission from nearby MSNs. The connection probability was higher for pairs with presynaptic striatopallidal MSNs; however, the variability in synaptic dynamics did not depend on the types of interconnected MSNs. The differences between the two inhibitory pathways were clear in both species and at different developmental stages. Our findings show that the two intrastriatal inhibitory pathways have fundamentally different dynamic properties that are, however, similarly applied to both direct and indirect striatal projections.</p>",

      "abstractNote": "Mitophagy is a selective autophagic process, essential for cellular homeostasis, that eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria. Activated by inner membrane depolarization, it plays an important role during development and is fundamental in highly differentiated post-mitotic cells that are highly dependent on aerobic metabolism, such as neurons, muscle cells, and hepatocytes. Both defective and excessive mitophagy have been proposed to contribute to age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, metabolic diseases, vascular complications of diabetes, myocardial injury, muscle dystrophy, and liver disease, among others. Pharmacological or dietary interventions that restore mitophagy homeostasis and facilitate the elimination of irreversibly damaged mitochondria, thus, could serve as potential therapies in several chronic diseases. However, despite extraordinary advances in this field, mainly derived from in vitro and preclinical animal models, human applications based on the regulation of mitochondrial quality in patients have not yet been approved. In this review, we summarize the key selective mitochondrial autophagy pathways and their role in prevalent chronic human diseases and highlight the potential use of specific interventions.",

      "abstractNote": "Habit formation is a behavioral adaptation that automates routine actions. Habitual behavior correlates with broad reconfigurations of dorsolateral striatal (DLS) circuit properties that increase gain and shift pathway timing. The mechanism(s) for these circuit adaptations are unknown and could be responsible for habitual behavior. Here we find that a single class of interneuron, fast- spiking interneurons (FSIs), modulates all of these habit-predictive properties. Consistent with a role in habits, FSIs are more excitable in habitual mice compared to goal-directed and acute chemogenetic inhibition of FSIs in DLS prevents the expression of habitual lever pressing. In vivo recordings further reveal a previously unappreciated selective modulation of SPNs based on their firing patterns; FSIs inhibit most SPNs but paradoxically promote the activity of a subset displaying high fractions of gamma-frequency spiking. These results establish a microcircuit mechanism for habits and provide a new example of how interneurons mediate experience-dependent behavior. © O’Hare et al.",

      "abstractNote": "Prediction errors are differences between expected and actual sensory input and are thought to be key computational signals that drive learning related plasticity. One way that prediction errors could drive learning is by activating neuromodulatory systems to gate plasticity. The catecholaminergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a major neuromodulatory system involved in neuronal plasticity in the cortex. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice exploring a virtual environment, we found that the activity of LC axons in the cortex correlated with the magnitude of unsigned visuomotor prediction errors. LC response profiles were similar in both motor and visual cortical areas, indicating that LC axons broadcast prediction errors throughout the dorsal cortex. While imaging calcium activity in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex, we found that optogenetic stimulation of LC axons facilitated learning of a stimulus-specific suppression of visual responses during locomotion. This plasticity - induced by minutes of LC stimulation - recapitulated the effect of visuomotor learning on a scale that is normally observed during visuomotor development across days. We conclude that prediction errors drive LC activity, and that LC activity facilitates sensorimotor plasticity in the cortex, consistent with a role in modulating learning rates. © 2023, Jordan and Keller.",

      "abstractNote": "Psychosis is characterized by a diminished ability of the brain to distinguish externally driven activity patterns from self-generated activity patterns. Antipsychotic drugs are a class of small molecules with relatively broad binding affinity for a variety of neuromodulator receptors that, in humans, can prevent or ameliorate psychosis. How these drugs influence the function of cortical circuits, and in particular their ability to distinguish between externally and self-generated activity patterns, is still largely unclear. To have experimental control over self-generated sensory feedback, we used a virtual reality environment in which the coupling between movement and visual feedback can be altered. We then used widefield calcium imaging to determine the cell type-specific functional effects of antipsychotic drugs in mouse dorsal cortex under different conditions of visuomotor coupling. By comparing cell type-specific activation patterns between locomotion onsets that were experimentally coupled to self-generated visual feedback and locomotion onsets that were not coupled, we show that deep cortical layers were differentially activated in these two conditions. We then show that the antipsychotic drug clozapine disrupted visuomotor integration at locomotion onsets also primarily in deep cortical layers. Given that one of the key components of visuomotor integration in cortex is long-range cortico-cortical connections, we tested whether the effect of clozapine was detectable in the correlation structure of activity patterns across dorsal cortex. We found that clozapine as well as two other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole and haloperidol, resulted in a strong reduction in correlations of layer 5 activity between cortical areas and impaired the spread of visuomotor prediction errors generated in visual cortex. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that a major functional effect of antipsychotic drugs is a selective alteration of long-range layer 5-mediated communication.",
